UTIL-ARCHIVER-Zip
=================

zip is a compression and file packaging utility for  Unix,        VMS,  MSDOS, OS/2, Windows NT, Minix, Atari and Macintosh.        It is analogous to a  combination  of  the  UNIX  commands        tar(1)  and compress(1) and is compatible with PKZIP (Phil        Katz's ZIP for MSDOS systems).
